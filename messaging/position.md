# Messaging House - Position

Our Position is our market space, and the competing alternatives we go up against. 

Use this section when performing market and competitive research. Also use this section to ensure messaging is relevant to industry trends and market directions, and that messaging is clearly differentiated amongst the rest.

## Messaging Blocks

### Market Landscape

[Instructions:
Provide an opinionated description of the market space you operate in. Focus on scenarios, trends, inflection points, and constraints shaping buyer behavior. This should explain why the market looks the way it does today and why change is necessary.

Claude will use this to establish relevance and urgency, especially in thought leadership, blog content, and top-of-funnel assets.]

[Tips:
– Anchor on market forces - technology shifts, operating models, regulatory changes, economic impacts, competitive moves, etc.
– Speak to industry trends - big movements, hype cycles, converging/consolidating/dying categories, etc.
– Introduce your unique perspective on the market today and where it's headed in your favor
]

[Format:
2-3 short paragraphs describing the market]

### Positioning Statement

[Instructions:
Document your relative position in the market by clearly stating who you're for and why you're different. This should reflect your unique perspective on the market, not just your offering.

Claude will use this as the baseline for differentiation across messaging.]

[Tips:
– Read April Dunford's book, Obviously Awesome
– Aim for your vision, but stay closer to reality
– Write to the common positioning framework for Claude's understanding]

[Format:
- For (Target Audience)
- Who (Statement of Need)
- And Want (Statement of Expectations)
- We are (Primary Position / Category)
- That (Statement of Key Benefit).
- Unlike (Alternatives)
- We (Primary Differentiation).
- Only Us (Unique Approach).
- With Us (Primary Gain)].

### Categories in Play

[Instructions:
List the market categories you align with or intersect with. For each category, carve out a distinct profile in `/messaging/categories/[category-name].md`

Claude will reference individual categories when performing market research, and to understand where you fit relative to the larger market space. Claude will also use this to keep messaging relevant to specific category contexts when applicable.

When researching specific categories in your task workflow, extract the details from files in `/messaging/categories/`

| Category             | Source Files     |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Category A (Acronym) | category-a.md    |
| Category B (Acronym) | category-b.md    |
| Category C (Acronym) | category-c.md    |

### Competing Alternatives

[Instructions:
List the alternatives customers evaluate instead of choosing you. This includes vendors, DIY, and inaction. Focus on patterns of choice, not just named competitors - this is scoped to messaging, not your competitive intelligence hub. For each competing alternative, carve out a distinct profile in `/messaging/competitors/[competitor-name].md`

Claude will reference specific alternatives when performing market research, and to understand where you fit relative to the competitive landscape. Claude will also use this to sharpen contrast, frame trade-offs, and message with clear differentiation.]

When researching specific alternatives in your task workflow, extract the details from files in `/messaging/competitors/`

| Category       | Source Files      |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Competitor A   | competitor-a.md   |
| Competitor B   | competitor-b.md   |
| Competitor C   | competitor-c.md   |

## Rules

## Guidelines

- Use the Market Landscape to gain an understanding of the space
- Use the Positioning Statement to anchor relative positioning and to establish differentiation
- Use the Categories in Play to stay accurate and relevant to specific scenarios

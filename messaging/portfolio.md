# Messaging House - Portfolio

The Portfolio defines what we offer and how it is structured.

Use this section to understand the shape, hierarchy, and scope of our offerings so messaging stays at the correct altitude and references the right products and solutions at the right time.

## Messaging Blocks

### Portfolio Overview

[Instructions:
Describe the high-level structure of your offering. This may be a single product, a multi-product portfolio, a platform with add-ons, or a combination of products and services.

Claude will use this to determine whether to speak at the platform, portfolio, or product level in messaging.]

[Tips:
– Prioritize structure over detail
– Clarify relationships between products (core vs add-on, platform vs application, bundled vs standalone)
– Avoid feature-level discussion here]

[Format:
1 short paragraph describing the portfolio structure and relationships]

### Product Details

Products are the canonical units of offering within the portfolio. 

Reference products intentionally and only when they are relevant to the scenario, persona, or use case.

When specific products are related to your task workflow, extract the respective profile in `/messaging/products/` for in-depth messaging.

| Product   | File           | 
|-----------|----------------|
| Product A | product-a.md   |
| Product B | product-b.md   |
| Product C | product-c.md   |

[Instructions:
Document each product as a discrete profile.

Claude will use this to introduce or reference specific offerings when applicable.]

### Solutions

Solutions are the use cases of the product in practice.

Use these to ground messaging in real jobs-to-be-done scenarios and desired outcomes.

When specific solutions are related to your task workflow, extract the respective profile in `/messaging/solutions/` for in-depth messaging.

| Solution   | File            | 
|------------|-----------------|
| Solution A | solution-a.md   |
| Solution B | solution-b.md   |
| Solution C | solution-c.md   |

[Instructions:
Document repeatable, outcome-oriented solutions where the portfolio delivers meaningful and measurable value. Solutions may span multiple products or apply to a single product. For each solution, carve out a distinct profile in `/messaging/solutions/[solution-name].md`

Claude will use these as tip of the spear messaging, and to achor business and technical value to what teams are looking to accomplish.]

[Tips:
– Aim for solutions that are both hands-on practical for practitioners and valuable to the business
- When you have a lot of solutions, try to logically group them to avoid messaging sprawl]

## Rules

- Portfolio defines altitude — use it to speak broadly about the offering
- Products define scope — introduce them only when specificity is required
- Capabilities justify value — use them to explain why outcomes are achievable
- Technical details support credibility — include them selectively and last

## Guidelines

- Avoid long feature lists; introduce capabilities sparingly when they're additive to a value-led narrative
- Prefer buyer outcomes and use cases over product mechanics
- Elevate product value to meaningful, measurable business or technical impact

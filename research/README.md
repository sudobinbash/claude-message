# Research Directory

Drop any existing documents here to avoid redundant web searches.
Skills will scan this directory and prioritize local content.

## What to Add

Add any files containing:
- Company information (about pages, press releases, funding)
- Existing messaging (boilerplate, positioning, taglines)
- Customer content (case studies, testimonials, quotes)
- Competitive intelligence (battlecards, comparisons)
- Market research (analyst reports, industry data)

## How It Works

1. Add files to this directory (any format: .md, .txt, .pdf, copied content)
2. When a skill runs, it scans and summarizes what's available
3. Skills extract relevant information before searching online
4. You'll see what was found locally vs. what needed a search

No required file structure - organize however you prefer.

## What Skills Look For

## Tips

- **More is better than less**: Add raw content, skills will extract what's relevant
- **Include sources**: Add URLs or dates when you can
- **Any format works**: Markdown, plain text, PDFs, copied content all work
- **No cleanup needed**: Skills handle messy content fine

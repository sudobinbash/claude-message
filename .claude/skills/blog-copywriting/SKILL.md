## SEO/GEO Optimization

**Chunk-based structure:**
- Break content into 200-300 word sections with descriptive H2/H3 headers
- Each section should be quotable by AI engines
- Use keywords naturally in headers and first sentences

**AI-friendly elements:**
- Direct Q&A format where appropriate
- Bullet point summaries at section ends
- Data points that can stand alone as citations
- Clear definitions for technical terms

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- Author credentials and expertise
- Original research and data
- Citations to authoritative sources
- Customer quotes and case studies

**Technical foundations:**
- Meta descriptions optimized for AI summarization (150-160 characters)
- Alt text for images and data visualizations

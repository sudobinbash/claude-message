# Twitter/X Post Guide

Single posts for quick insights, engagement, and real-time commentary.

## When to Use

- Reacting to industry news or events
- Sharing quick observations or hot takes
- Engaging with trending conversations
- Building consistent presence (3-5x per day optimal)
- Promoting content with link in reply

## Post Types

### Observation Post
```
[Specific thing you noticed]

[Why it matters or what it means]
```

### Take/Opinion Post
```
[Strong statement or position]

[Brief supporting evidence or reasoning]
```

### Question Post
```
[Genuine question about industry topic]

[Optional: Your initial thought or why you're asking]
```

### News Reaction
```
[What happened - brief context]

[Your take on why it matters]
```

## Hook Patterns

**Effective openers:**
- Direct observation: "Most [teams] underestimate..."
- Contrarian take: "Unpopular opinion: [position]"
- Pattern recognition: "I've noticed that the best [roles]..."
- Question: "Why do we still [common practice]?"
- Specific detail: "Just saw [specific thing]. This is why..."

**Avoid:**
- "Thread:" or "1/" for single posts
- "Hot take:" (overdone)
- Generic motivation quotes
- "This." responses

## Format Guidelines

**Length:** 200-250 characters optimal (280 max)

**Structure:**
- Lead with the insight, not the setup
- One idea per post
- No hashtag stuffing (1-2 max, only if relevant)

**Links:**
- Never in main post body (throttled by algorithm)
- Add in reply: "Link for context: [url]"
- Or: "Wrote more about this here" + link in reply

**Media:**
- Images get 2x engagement
- Video gets 2x organic reach
- Screenshots of interesting content work well
- Memes if they fit your voice

## Example Structures

**Observation (under 200 chars):**
```
The teams shipping fastest aren't the ones with the most process.

They're the ones with the clearest decision-making authority.
```

**Take (with evidence):**
```
Enterprise sales cycles are getting longer, not shorter.

Three deals this quarter took 6+ months that would have closed in 90 days two years ago.

The "urgent" budget is gone.
```

**Question (genuine):**
```
Curious: How are security teams handling the explosion of AI-generated code?

Seeing a lot of "we'll figure it out" but not many concrete approaches yet.
```

## Engagement Strategy

**First hour is critical:**
- Reply to comments immediately
- Quote-tweet with added insight
- Engage with others before posting

**70/30 rule:**
- 70% of time: Engaging with others
- 30% of time: Creating new posts

**Reply game:**
- Add value in replies to bigger accounts
- Don't just agree—extend the point
- Your best ideas can come from replies

## What Performs

**High engagement signals:**
- Specific > generic
- Experience-based > theoretical
- Controversial (but substantive) > safe
- Questions that invite real answers
- Vulnerability or admitting mistakes

**Algorithm priorities:**
- Replies weighted 27x more than likes
- Early engagement determines reach
- External links heavily penalized
- Consistent posting > sporadic bursts

## Tropes to Avoid

- "This is huge" (without substance)
- Emoji-heavy posts (🔥🚀💡)
- "RT if you agree"
- Vague inspirational content
- Self-promotion without value
- Threads disguised as single posts
- "I'll never forget when..."
- Humble-brags

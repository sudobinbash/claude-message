### Best Practices for Newsletters

**Consistency:**
- Pick a cadence and stick to it (weekly or bi-weekly)
- Establish a recognizable format
- Maintain consistent voice and POV

**Subscriber value:**
- Deliver something they can't get elsewhere
- Include original thinking, not aggregation
- Make each edition worth their notification

## Headline Patterns

**Effective:**
- "Why [Common Practice] Is Holding Your [Team] Back"
- "The Hidden Cost of [Trend Everyone Follows]"
- "What [Years of Experience] Taught Me About [Topic]"
- "A Framework for [Specific Challenge]"

**Avoid:**
- "Everything You Need to Know About..."
- "The Ultimate Guide to..."
- "X Things Every [Role] Should Know"
- Clickbait that overpromises

## Format Guidelines

**Length:**
- Articles: 1,200-2,500 words (longer only if depth warrants)
- Newsletters: 800-1,500 words per edition

**Visual structure:**
- H2 headers every 200-300 words
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullet lists for scannable sections
- Pull quotes for key insights

**Images:**
- Use sparingly and purposefully
- Original diagrams > stock photos
- Alt text for accessibility

## Distribution Strategy

**For articles:**
- Share excerpt as LinkedIn post
- Link in comment or "continue reading" CTA
- Republish key insights as standalone posts later

**For newsletters:**
- Tease upcoming edition in regular posts
- Cross-promote from other channels
- Engage with subscriber comments

## Quality Signals

**What makes long-form work:**
- Original perspective not found elsewhere
- Specific examples from real experience
- Data or evidence supporting claims
- Clear structure that rewards reading
- Actionable takeaways

**Red flags:**
- Generic advice available anywhere
- All theory, no practical application
- Overly promotional tone
- Padding to hit word count
- No clear POV or thesis

# Twitter/X Thread Guide

Multi-post threads for thought leadership, storytelling, and deep dives.

## When to Use

- Breaking down complex topics
- Telling stories that need more room
- Sharing frameworks or methodologies
- Summarizing learnings or research
- Building authority on specific subjects

## Thread Structures

### Framework Thread (5-7 posts)
```
1. [Hook: Problem this framework solves]
2. [Framework overview / why existing approaches fail]
3-5. [Each component with brief explanation]
6. [How to apply it]
7. [Summary + where to learn more]
```

### Story Thread (5-8 posts)
```
1. [Hook: Outcome or tension]
2. [Setup: Context and stakes]
3-5. [What happened: Key moments]
6-7. [What you learned]
8. [Takeaway for reader]
```

### Breakdown Thread (6-10 posts)
```
1. [Hook: What you're breaking down and why it matters]
2. [Context: Why most people miss this]
3-8. [Point-by-point breakdown with specifics]
9. [Synthesis: What this all means]
10. [Call to action or question]
```

### Lessons Thread (5-7 posts)
```
1. [Hook: Experience that generated lessons]
2-6. [One lesson per post with context]
7. [Biggest takeaway or what you'd do differently]
```

## Hook Patterns (Post 1)

**The hook determines whether anyone reads the rest.**

**Effective hooks:**
- Outcome-first: "I spent 3 years building [thing]. Here's what nobody tells you."
- Tension: "Most [role] advice is wrong. Here's what actually works."
- Specificity: "We grew from $1M to $10M ARR with this approach:"
- Promise: "A thread on [specific topic] that took me [time] to learn."

**Avoid:**
- "Thread:" or "A thread on..." (let the content speak)
- Starting with "1/" (signals low confidence)
- Vague promises: "This changed everything"
- Meta-commentary on your own thread

## Post-by-Post Guidelines

**Post 1 (Hook):**
- Self-contained value or clear promise
- Must earn the click on "Show this thread"
- Under 250 characters if possible

**Posts 2-N (Body):**
- Each post should stand alone conceptually
- One idea per post
- Avoid orphan sentences that need previous context
- Natural flow but not dependent transitions

**Final post:**
- Summary or key takeaway
- Call to action (follow, reply, share thoughts)
- Link if relevant (only in final or reply)

## Format Guidelines

**Length:** 5-7 posts optimal (10 max unless truly warranted)

**Structure within posts:**
- Lead with insight, not setup
- Line breaks for readability
- No numbering needed (Twitter shows thread structure)

**Media:**
- Images can break up long threads
- Screenshots for examples
- Diagrams for frameworks
- Don't force media where it doesn't add value

**Links:**
- Never in posts 1-N (algorithm penalty)
- Final post or separate reply only
- "Wrote more about this: [link]"

## Example Thread Flow

```
Post 1:
After 50+ customer interviews, I found the same objection killing deals.

It wasn't price. It wasn't competition.

Here's what it was (and how we fixed it):

Post 2:
The objection: "This sounds great, but we tried something similar before."

Not a feature problem. Not a trust problem.

A timing and change management problem.

Post 3:
What we learned: They weren't objecting to our product.

They were objecting to the pain of switching.

The last vendor burned them. They're protecting themselves.

Post 4:
The fix wasn't selling harder.

It was acknowledging the past failure directly.

"What went wrong last time?"

Then showing specifically how we're different.

Post 5:
Three things that made the difference:

- Reference customers who also had bad prior experiences
- Phased rollout instead of big-bang migration
- Clear success metrics at 30/60/90 days

Post 6:
Result: Close rate went from 18% to 34% on deals where this objection came up.

The lesson: Don't fight the objection. Understand what's behind it.

Post 7:
If you're selling into accounts that have been burned before:

Lead with empathy, not features.

Your differentiation isn't your product—it's your approach to risk.
```

## Thread Quality Signals

**Good threads:**
- Each post adds new information
- Specific examples and evidence
- Genuine insight not available elsewhere
- Natural progression of ideas
- Worth the time to read all posts

**Red flags:**
- Padding to hit post count
- Generic advice stretched thin
- Obvious AI-generated parallel structure
- Each post just restates the hook
- No specific examples or evidence

## Tropes to Avoid

- "A thread on..." or "Thread:" openers
- Numbered lists in every post (1., 2., 3.)
- Perfect emoji bullet points (🔵🔵🔵)
- "Let me explain" or "Here's the thing"
- Self-congratulatory endings
- Engagement bait: "Retweet if this helped"
- Cliffhanger posts with no payoff

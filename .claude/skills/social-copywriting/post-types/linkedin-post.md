# LinkedIn Post Guide

Short-form posts for thought leadership, engagement, and brand visibility.

## When to Use

- Sharing a single insight or observation
- Reacting to industry news or trends
- Personal stories with professional relevance
- Promoting content without external links
- Building consistent presence (3-5x per week)

## Structure Options

### Insight Post
```
[Hook: Contrarian observation or surprising data point]

[Context: Why this matters or how you learned it]

[Insight: Your unique take or lesson]

[Implication: What this means for the reader]
```

### Story Post
```
[Hook: Moment of tension or turning point]

[Setup: Brief context]

[What happened: Specific details]

[What you learned: Insight or takeaway]
```

### Observation Post
```
[Pattern you've noticed]

[Evidence: 2-3 specific examples]

[Why this is happening]

[What to do about it]
```

## Hook Patterns That Work

**Tension-based:**
- "Most [role] get this wrong..."
- "I changed my mind about [topic]..."
- "The uncomfortable truth about [subject]..."

**Curiosity-based:**
- "I spent [time] doing [thing]. Here's what I learned."
- "[Surprising statistic or observation]"
- "Nobody talks about this, but..."

**Story-based:**
- "Last week, [specific thing happened]..."
- "A [customer/colleague] asked me [question]..."
- "I almost [did something]. Then [insight]."

**Avoid:**
- "I'm excited to announce..."
- "Thrilled to share..."
- "5 tips for..."
- "Here's the thing about..."

## Format Guidelines

**Length:** 800-1,500 characters optimal (3,000 max)

**Line breaks:**
- Single line for hook
- Blank line after hook
- 2-3 sentence paragraphs
- Blank lines between sections

**Hashtags:**
- 1-3 maximum
- Place at end, not inline
- Use specific tags over broad ones

**Links:**
- Avoid in post body (reduces reach 20-35%)
- Add in first comment if needed
- Or use "link in comments" approach

## Example Structure

```
[Hook line that earns the scroll-stop]

[2-3 sentences of context or setup]

[Core insight or observation - this is the meat]

[Implication or call to reflection]

## Engagement Strategy

**First 60-90 minutes matter most:**
- Respond to every comment quickly
- Ask follow-up questions to commenters
- Tag relevant people only if genuinely additive

**Designed for conversation:**
- End with genuine question or invitation
- Leave room for disagreement
- Acknowledge complexity

## Tropes to Avoid

- Perfect 5-point lists with emoji bullets
- "Agree?" as the entire CTA
- Humble-bragging disguised as lessons
- Overly polished corporate speak
- Inspirational quotes without context
- Engagement bait ("Comment YES if...")

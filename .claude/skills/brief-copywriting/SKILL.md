|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|

## Design Principles

- **Scannable in 30 seconds:** Executive skim test—key points visible without reading
- **One takeaway per page:** Don't overload; let each page land a single point
- **Visual hierarchy:** Headlines, subheads, callouts guide the eye
- **Proof in every section:** Data, customer quotes, or specific outcomes
- **Clear CTA:** Reader knows exactly what to do next

## Content Principles

- Lead with the reader's problem, not your product
- Quantify outcomes wherever possible
- Include customer proof or data validation
- Avoid jargon unless audience-appropriate
- Every claim must be supportable

## Tropes to Avoid

- "Leading provider of..." openers
- Feature lists without context
- Generic benefits that apply to any vendor
- Missing or buried CTA
- Inconsistent altitude within the document
- Unsubstantiated superlatives
